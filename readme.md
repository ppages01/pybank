# Pybank
A Python script for analyzing the financial records. Financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. ( the records are simple.)

* Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* The output should look similar to the one below:

In addition, your final script will both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
